With a professional background in managing building and infrastructure projects, facilities and corporate real estate, Wipro is my ﬁrst foray with an IT ﬁrm. I’ve 30 years of work experience now, and I have had an opportunity to work with some of the large public and private sectors. <br/><br/>\nOn the personal front, my wife is a homemaker and I have two kids. The elder one, my daughter, is pursuing her MBA from IIM Lucknow, and my son is pursuing computer engineering from Delhi Technological University.<br/><br/>\nDuring the present situation, I try to ﬁt in some of my workout routines at the start of the day, some during the day and some in the evening. I meditate and \npractise breathing exercises for at least 30 minutes in the morning, exercise in the evening for an hour which includes strength training and cardio and \nﬁnally catch up with some shows late at night with my family.<br/><br/>Back to the professional goals, there are certainly more than two things that need focus and attention in global operations as we embark on a journey of transformation that Wipro is on. But I aim to execute two immediate perspectives, one is the optimisation of a global real estate portfolio and the other is enhancing employee experience by considering global operations as one of the search functions that touch the lives of 200,000+Wiproites daily.\n<br/><br/>\nOver the last 100 days post joining Wipro, I’ve witnessed the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct. I think the one word that perfectly describes Wipro and its people is ‘ethical’.","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-2":"I started my career as an IT professional and eventually moved into Talent Acquisition. Today, I am extremely passionate about TA and as the head of the TA team for Brazil, I look forward to bringing in my experience to build a strong team of TA professionals and make Wipro a TA reference company in the region.\n<br/><br/>\nIf I wasn’t in my current career, I surely would have been in the IT sector or become a BJJ professor. \n<br/><br/>\nThroughout my career, I have got the opportunities to live and work in places like Italy, UK, the USA, and some countries in LATAM. \n<br/><br/>\nI’ve always looked up to my mother, who has always inspired me to achieve the best for the moment. In my leisure time, I take my kids, Pedro and Lizi, to the countryside and spend quality time there.","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-5":"“Wipro is not just a job for me but my passion to help drive growth and change for people.”\n<br/><br/>\nHello, I’m Robert, and I’ve joined Wipro in April’21 as the VP and Global Head of Change and Transformation. Over the last 10 years of my work\nexperience at Microsoft, I have helped in building the organisational change practice to bring transformation.\n<br/><br/>\nOn a personal note, I’m a business psychologist living in Switzerland in the countryside with my family. I have three kids, and playing Lego\nworks like a stress buster to me. Well, I’m a Lego Serious play professional facilitator too. One of my hobbies is wedding planning, and I've\nbeen doing this only for very close friends and family members for the last 20 years. I’m passionate about helping people grow through high\nenergetic events; it’s that same passion that I’m looking forward to bringing into the business within Wipro.\n<br/><br/>\nThat being said, Wipro is not just a job for me but my passion to help drive growth and change for people. I think the key focus areas for\nbringing change and transformation practice is basically twofold. Here, one is to help leaders and managers to run their change initiatives\nfor top and bottom-line impact. The other is to create energy and movement to bring people together in workshop settings, community\nevents to connect the dots and help in providing clarity around the change initiatives.","IMG_1":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_1-en-us-1636721647012.png","IMG_2":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_2-en-us-1636721610784.png","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-3":"I joined Wipro 6 months ago as the Chief Technology Officer. Prior to joining Wipro, I worked at PayPal and Walmart, leading Technology Infrastructure teams; building data, infrastructure, and data science platforms.\n<br><br>\nI believe that we can transform Wipro into a dominant technology player, generating value and fueling growth for our customers. Wipro is an organization with a strong technology DNA and takes pride in its craftsmanship. I am looking forward to executing 3 C's to accomplish such a transformation.\n<br><br>\nThe first C is Competency, which we will build through investing in R & D, ecosystem partnerships, and generating brand value earning us the right to play. The second C stands for Capabilities. We will be investing in building platforms and software assets that will help us with faster Time-To-Market, Quality, and Predictability in delivery which will help us serve our customers better. And the third C is Customer-Centricity, focused on leveraging the right technology, assets, and platforms, to solve our customer's pain points. These three C's will lead us to earn the right to win, driving top-line and bottom-line growth.\n<br><br>\nIn regards to my personal life, I live with my family in the Bay area. I have two children; my oldest child is in college and my younger son is a junior in high school. In my free time, I like to read, specifically works on English literature, management, and philosophy. I like to listen to podcasts and my two favorites are 'How I built this' and 'The Hidden Brain.'","IMG_3":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_3-en-us-1636721522374.png","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-4":"“I strongly believe that we’re going to be a global leader in Cybersecurity and Risk Services”\n<br/><br/>\nI joined Wipro in December 2020 as the Senior Vice President and Business Head for Cybersecurity and Risk Services. Previously, I have spent about 17 years at KPMG as a partner of running the US in the global cyber businesses.\n<br/><br/>\nAs the head of the global Cybersecurity and Risk business, I am really excited to take full advantage of all of the opportunities to become a global leader in a full suite of services in cyber-- advisory services, system integration services, in addition to the ongoing run-and-operate of managed  services. My strategy is to help us move from a leader position in one discipline to all three disciplines, and we will achieve that through senior talent acquisition, by refreshing our service catalogs, methodologies and frameworks, and go-to-market approach.\n<br/><br/>\nThe one word I would use to describe Wipro and the people of Wipro is “passion”. I've seen it in every individual that I've met and worked with. Their passion for the customers, culture and the communities we serve is unrivaled in the industry today. I'm extremely happy to be here and I look forward to working with each and every one of you. Take care.\n<br/><br/>\nSpeaking about my family, I live with my wife Nita, daughter Maya, who is 18 and my son Gian, who is 13 in Naperville, Illinois. I’ve been married since 1999 and it's been an unbelievable experience ever since."},"CC":{"LINKEDIN_NOTE":"Note: This will open in a new tab"},"SKU-d8-1":{"CTA":"<a token-data=\"LP.SKU-d8-1.CTA\" token-type=\"text\" class=\"g-link\" href=\"/why-wipro#who-we-are\">Join Wipro to shape the greatest transformations in tech. <img src=\"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-d8-1-CTA-ICON-en-us-1696612691469.png\" alt=\"\"/></a>","PARA_4":"<p token-data=\"LP.SKU-d8-1.PARA_4\" token-type=\"text\">If this sounds like the challenge you have been looking for, join us and show us what you have got!</p>","PARA_3":"<p token-data=\"LP.SKU-d8-1.PARA_3\" token-type=\"text\">We focus on cultivating fearless teams, confident in rising to the challenge and working in alignment with our values.</p>","TITLE":"<h3 token-data=\"LP.SKU-d8-1.TITLE\" token-type=\"text\">Why Wipro</h3>","PARA_2":"<p token-data=\"LP.SKU-d8-1.PARA_2\" token-type=\"text\"><b>Reinvention is in our DNA.</b></p>","PARA_1":"<p token-data=\"LP.SKU-d8-1.PARA_1\" token-type=\"text\">At Wipro, we are constantly boosting our platform for our clients to continue to be change makers - redefining the limits of technology to drive success.</p>"},"SKU-B-6-MODAL-4":{"IMG_1":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B-6-MODAL-4-IMG_1-en-us-1636700154290.png"},"SKU-B4":{"MARKS_2":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MARKS_2-en-us-1603289974417.png","MARKS_1":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MARKS_1-en-us-1603289749380.png","TITLE_1":"Because we \nbelieve in People \nInvestment","TITLE_2":"Because we believe in People Investment","TITLE_3":"Because we believe in People Investment","HEADER_1":"Meet Our People","BG-IMG_2":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro/assets/LP-SKU-B4-BG-IMG_2-en-us-1583255751223.jpg","BG-IMG_3":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro/assets/LP-SKU-B4-BG-IMG_2-en-us-1583255751223.jpg","BG-IMG_1":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro/assets/LP-SKU-B4-BG-IMG_1-en-us-1583235582943.jpg","POSITION_1":"Managing Partner, Wipro Ventures","POSITION_2":"Vice President, Topcoder","POSITION_3":"Vice President, Topcoder","QUOTE_2":"Wipro is an open and energetic place to think and execute your ideas.

With a professional background in managing building and infrastructure \nprojects, facilities and corporate real estate, Wipro is my ﬁrst foray with an IT ﬁrm. I’ve 30 years of work experience now, and I have had an opportunity to \nwork with some of the large public and private sectors. <br/><br/>\nOn the personal front, my wife is a homemaker and I have two kids. The elder one, my daughter, is pursuing her MBA from IIM Lucknow, and my son is \npursuing computer engineering from Delhi Technological University.\n<br/><br/>During the present situation, I try to ﬁt in some of my workout routines at the start of the day, some during the day and some in the evening. I meditate and \npractise breathing exercises for at least 30 minutes in the morning, exercise in the evening for an hour which includes strength training and cardio and \nﬁnally catch up with some shows late at night with my family.\n<br/><br/>Back to the professional goals, there are certainly more than two things that need focus and attention in global operations as we embark on a journey of \ntransformation that Wipro is on. But I aim to execute two immediate perspectives, one is the optimisation of a global real estate portfolio and the other is \nenhancing employee experience by considering global operations as one of the search functions that touch the lives of 200,000+Wiproites daily.<br/><br/>Over the last 100 days post joining Wipro, I’ve witnessed the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct. I think the one word that perfectly \ndescribes Wipro and its people is ‘ethical’.","IMG_1-1":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-IMG_1-1-en-us-1636702225386.png","NAME_2":"Anup Purohit","IMG_1":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-IMG_1-en-us-1636700503175.png","IMG_2":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-IMG_2-en-us-1636710751991.png","NAME_1":"Dinesh Wadehra"},"NEWSROOM":{"CTA":"<a token-data=\"LP.NEWSROOM.CTA\" token-type=\"text\" class=\"n-main-cta\" href=\"https://careers.wipro.com/careers-home/\">Learn more</a>","PARA":"<p token-data=\"LP.NEWSROOM.PARA\" token-type=\"text\">Stay informed about the latest developments, opportunities, and insights related to careers at Wipro.</p>","TITLE":"<h3 token-data=\"LP.NEWSROOM.TITLE\" token-type=\"text\">Careers Newsroom</h3>"},"SKU-F7-1":{"NAME_6":"Africa","NAME_7":"Asia","NAME_4":"Continental Europe","NAME_5":"UK and Ireland","NAME_8":"Australia","NAME_9":"India","NAME_2":"Canada","NAME_10":"Middle East","NAME_3":"Latam","NAME_1":"USA"},"SKU-D4-1":{"CTA":"<a href=\"/life-at-wipro\" token-data=\"LP.SKU-D4.CTA\" token-type=\"text\"> know more <img src=\"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-D4-CTA-ARROW-en-us-1584617612063.svg\" token-data=\"LP.SKU-D4.CTA-ARROW\" token-type=\"text\" alt=\"\"> </a>","IMG":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-D4-1-IMG-en-us-1586174244523.jpg","PARAGRAPH":"Our culture is a foundation of our success and it is completely people oriented, touching lives and making a difference to employees, stakeholders, customers and partners alike.

With a professional background in managing building and infrastructure projects, facilities and corporate real estate, Wipro is my ﬁrst foray with an IT ﬁrm. I’ve 30 years of work experience now, and I have had an opportunity to work with some of the large public and private sectors. <br/><br/>\nOn the personal front, my wife is a homemaker and I have two kids. The elder one, my daughter, is pursuing her MBA from IIM Lucknow, and my son is pursuing computer engineering from Delhi Technological University.<br/><br/>\nDuring the present situation, I try to ﬁt in some of my workout routines at the start of the day, some during the day and some in the evening. I meditate and \npractise breathing exercises for at least 30 minutes in the morning, exercise in the evening for an hour which includes strength training and cardio and \nﬁnally catch up with some shows late at night with my family.<br/><br/>Back to the professional goals, there are certainly more than two things that need focus and attention in global operations as we embark on a journey of transformation that Wipro is on. But I aim to execute two immediate perspectives, one is the optimisation of a global real estate portfolio and the other is enhancing employee experience by considering global operations as one of the search functions that touch the lives of 200,000+Wiproites daily.\n<br/><br/>\nOver the last 100 days post joining Wipro, I’ve witnessed the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct. I think the one word that perfectly describes Wipro and its people is ‘ethical’.","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-2":"I started my career as an IT professional and eventually moved into Talent Acquisition. Today, I am extremely passionate about TA and as the head of the TA team for Brazil, I look forward to bringing in my experience to build a strong team of TA professionals and make Wipro a TA reference company in the region.\n<br/><br/>\nIf I wasn’t in my current career, I surely would have been in the IT sector or become a BJJ professor. \n<br/><br/>\nThroughout my career, I have got the opportunities to live and work in places like Italy, UK, the USA, and some countries in LATAM. \n<br/><br/>\nI’ve always looked up to my mother, who has always inspired me to achieve the best for the moment. In my leisure time, I take my kids, Pedro and Lizi, to the countryside and spend quality time there.","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-5":"“Wipro is not just a job for me but my passion to help drive growth and change for people.”\n<br/><br/>\nHello, I’m Robert, and I’ve joined Wipro in April’21 as the VP and Global Head of Change and Transformation. Over the last 10 years of my work\nexperience at Microsoft, I have helped in building the organisational change practice to bring transformation.\n<br/><br/>\nOn a personal note, I’m a business psychologist living in Switzerland in the countryside with my family. I have three kids, and playing Lego\nworks like a stress buster to me. Well, I’m a Lego Serious play professional facilitator too. One of my hobbies is wedding planning, and I've\nbeen doing this only for very close friends and family members for the last 20 years. I’m passionate about helping people grow through high\nenergetic events; it’s that same passion that I’m looking forward to bringing into the business within Wipro.\n<br/><br/>\nThat being said, Wipro is not just a job for me but my passion to help drive growth and change for people. I think the key focus areas for\nbringing change and transformation practice is basically twofold. Here, one is to help leaders and managers to run their change initiatives\nfor top and bottom-line impact. The other is to create energy and movement to bring people together in workshop settings, community\nevents to connect the dots and help in providing clarity around the change initiatives.","IMG_1":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_1-en-us-1636721647012.png","IMG_2":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_2-en-us-1636721610784.png","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-3":"I joined Wipro 6 months ago as the Chief Technology Officer. Prior to joining Wipro, I worked at PayPal and Walmart, leading Technology Infrastructure teams; building data, infrastructure, and data science platforms.\n<br><br>\nI believe that we can transform Wipro into a dominant technology player, generating value and fueling growth for our customers. Wipro is an organization with a strong technology DNA and takes pride in its craftsmanship. I am looking forward to executing 3 C's to accomplish such a transformation.\n<br><br>\nThe first C is Competency, which we will build through investing in R & D, ecosystem partnerships, and generating brand value earning us the right to play. The second C stands for Capabilities. We will be investing in building platforms and software assets that will help us with faster Time-To-Market, Quality, and Predictability in delivery which will help us serve our customers better. And the third C is Customer-Centricity, focused on leveraging the right technology, assets, and platforms, to solve our customer's pain points. These three C's will lead us to earn the right to win, driving top-line and bottom-line growth.\n<br><br>\nIn regards to my personal life, I live with my family in the Bay area. I have two children; my oldest child is in college and my younger son is a junior in high school. In my free time, I like to read, specifically works on English literature, management, and philosophy. I like to listen to podcasts and my two favorites are 'How I built this' and 'The Hidden Brain.'","IMG_3":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_3-en-us-1636721522374.png","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-4":"“I strongly believe that we’re going to be a global leader in Cybersecurity and Risk Services”\n<br/><br/>\nI joined Wipro in December 2020 as the Senior Vice President and Business Head for Cybersecurity and Risk Services. Previously, I have spent about 17 years at KPMG as a partner of running the US in the global cyber businesses.\n<br/><br/>\nAs the head of the global Cybersecurity and Risk business, I am really excited to take full advantage of all of the opportunities to become a global leader in a full suite of services in cyber-- advisory services, system integration services, in addition to the ongoing run-and-operate of managed  services. My strategy is to help us move from a leader position in one discipline to all three disciplines, and we will achieve that through senior talent acquisition, by refreshing our service catalogs, methodologies and frameworks, and go-to-market approach.\n<br/><br/>\nThe one word I would use to describe Wipro and the people of Wipro is “passion”. I've seen it in every individual that I've met and worked with. Their passion for the customers, culture and the communities we serve is unrivaled in the industry today. I'm extremely happy to be here and I look forward to working with each and every one of you. Take care.\n<br/><br/>\nSpeaking about my family, I live with my wife Nita, daughter Maya, who is 18 and my son Gian, who is 13 in Naperville, Illinois.

With a professional background in managing building and infrastructure projects, facilities and corporate real estate, Wipro is my ﬁrst foray with an IT ﬁrm. I’ve 30 years of work experience now, and I have had an opportunity to work with some of the large public and private sectors. <br/><br/>\nOn the personal front, my wife is a homemaker and I have two kids. The elder one, my daughter, is pursuing her MBA from IIM Lucknow, and my son is pursuing computer engineering from Delhi Technological University.<br/><br/>\nDuring the present situation, I try to ﬁt in some of my workout routines at the start of the day, some during the day and some in the evening. I meditate and \npractise breathing exercises for at least 30 minutes in the morning, exercise in the evening for an hour which includes strength training and cardio and \nﬁnally catch up with some shows late at night with my family.<br/><br/>Back to the professional goals, there are certainly more than two things that need focus and attention in global operations as we embark on a journey of transformation that Wipro is on. But I aim to execute two immediate perspectives, one is the optimisation of a global real estate portfolio and the other is enhancing employee experience by considering global operations as one of the search functions that touch the lives of 200,000+Wiproites daily.\n<br/><br/>\nOver the last 100 days post joining Wipro, I’ve witnessed the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct. I think the one word that perfectly describes Wipro and its people is ‘ethical’.","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-2":"I started my career as an IT professional and eventually moved into Talent Acquisition. Today, I am extremely passionate about TA and as the head of the TA team for Brazil, I look forward to bringing in my experience to build a strong team of TA professionals and make Wipro a TA reference company in the region.\n<br/><br/>\nIf I wasn’t in my current career, I surely would have been in the IT sector or become a BJJ professor. \n<br/><br/>\nThroughout my career, I have got the opportunities to live and work in places like Italy, UK, the USA, and some countries in LATAM. \n<br/><br/>\nI’ve always looked up to my mother, who has always inspired me to achieve the best for the moment. In my leisure time, I take my kids, Pedro and Lizi, to the countryside and spend quality time there.","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-5":"“Wipro is not just a job for me but my passion to help drive growth and change for people.”\n<br/><br/>\nHello, I’m Robert, and I’ve joined Wipro in April’21 as the VP and Global Head of Change and Transformation. Over the last 10 years of my work\nexperience at Microsoft, I have helped in building the organisational change practice to bring transformation.\n<br/><br/>\nOn a personal note, I’m a business psychologist living in Switzerland in the countryside with my family. I have three kids, and playing Lego\nworks like a stress buster to me. Well, I’m a Lego Serious play professional facilitator too. One of my hobbies is wedding planning, and I've\nbeen doing this only for very close friends and family members for the last 20 years. I’m passionate about helping people grow through high\nenergetic events; it’s that same passion that I’m looking forward to bringing into the business within Wipro.\n<br/><br/>\nThat being said, Wipro is not just a job for me but my passion to help drive growth and change for people. I think the key focus areas for\nbringing change and transformation practice is basically twofold. Here, one is to help leaders and managers to run their change initiatives\nfor top and bottom-line impact. The other is to create energy and movement to bring people together in workshop settings, community\nevents to connect the dots and help in providing clarity around the change initiatives.","IMG_1":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_1-en-us-1636721647012.png","IMG_2":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_2-en-us-1636721610784.png","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-3":"I joined Wipro 6 months ago as the Chief Technology Officer. Prior to joining Wipro, I worked at PayPal and Walmart, leading Technology Infrastructure teams; building data, infrastructure, and data science platforms.\n<br><br>\nI believe that we can transform Wipro into a dominant technology player, generating value and fueling growth for our customers. Wipro is an organization with a strong technology DNA and takes pride in its craftsmanship. I am looking forward to executing 3 C's to accomplish such a transformation.\n<br><br>\nThe first C is Competency, which we will build through investing in R & D, ecosystem partnerships, and generating brand value earning us the right to play. The second C stands for Capabilities. We will be investing in building platforms and software assets that will help us with faster Time-To-Market, Quality, and Predictability in delivery which will help us serve our customers better. And the third C is Customer-Centricity, focused on leveraging the right technology, assets, and platforms, to solve our customer's pain points. These three C's will lead us to earn the right to win, driving top-line and bottom-line growth.\n<br><br>\nIn regards to my personal life, I live with my family in the Bay area. I have two children; my oldest child is in college and my younger son is a junior in high school. In my free time, I like to read, specifically works on English literature, management, and philosophy. I like to listen to podcasts and my two favorites are 'How I built this' and 'The Hidden Brain.'","IMG_3":"https://cms.jibecdn.com/prod/wipro-careers-home/assets/LP-SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1-IMG_3-en-us-1636721522374.png","MODAL-PARAGRAPH-4":"“I strongly believe that we’re going to be a global leader in Cybersecurity and Risk Services”\n<br/><br/>\nI joined Wipro in December 2020 as the Senior Vice President and Business Head for Cybersecurity and Risk Services. Previously, I have spent about 17 years at KPMG as a partner of running the US in the global cyber businesses.\n<br/><br/>\nAs the head of the global Cybersecurity and Risk business, I am really excited to take full advantage of all of the opportunities to become a global leader in a full suite of services in cyber-- advisory services, system integration services, in addition to the ongoing run-and-operate of managed  services. My strategy is to help us move from a leader position in one discipline to all three disciplines, and we will achieve that through senior talent acquisition, by refreshing our service catalogs, methodologies and frameworks, and go-to-market approach.\n<br/><br/>\nThe one word I would use to describe Wipro and the people of Wipro is “passion”. I've seen it in every individual that I've met and worked with. Their passion for the customers, culture and the communities we serve is unrivaled in the industry today. I'm extremely happy to be here and I look forward to working with each and every one of you. Take care.\n<br/><br/>\nSpeaking about my family, I live with my wife Nita, daughter Maya, who is 18 and my son Gian, who is 13 in Naperville, Illinois.

I meditate and \npractise breathing exercises for at least 30 minutes in the morning, exercise in the evening for an hour which includes strength training and cardio and \nﬁnally catch up with some shows late at night with my family.\n<br/><br/>Back to the professional goals, there are certainly more than two things that need focus and attention in global operations as we embark on a journey of \ntransformation that Wipro is on. But I aim to execute two immediate perspectives, one is the optimisation of a global real estate portfolio and the other is \nenhancing employee experience by considering global operations as one of the search functions that touch the lives of 200,000+Wiproites daily.<br/><br/>Over the last 100 days post joining Wipro, I’ve witnessed the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct.

            <p token-data="LP.SKU-B4-MODAL-4-1.MODAL-PARAGRAPH-1" token-type="text">I joined Wipro as Global Operations Head about three and a half months back. With a professional background in managing building and infrastructure projects, facilities and corporate real estate, Wipro is my ﬁrst foray with an IT ﬁrm. I’ve 30 years of work experience now, and I have had an opportunity to work with some of the large public and private sectors. <br><br>
On the personal front, my wife is a homemaker and I have two kids. The elder one, my daughter, is pursuing her MBA from IIM Lucknow, and my son is pursuing computer engineering from Delhi Technological University.<br><br>
During the present situation, I try to ﬁt in some of my workout routines at the start of the day, some during the day and some in the evening. I meditate and 
practise breathing exercises for at least 30 minutes in the morning, exercise in the evening for an hour which includes strength training and cardio and 
ﬁnally catch up with some shows late at night with my family.<br><br>Back to the professional goals, there are certainly more than two things that need focus and attention in global operations as we embark on a journey of transformation that Wipro is on. But I aim to execute two immediate perspectives, one is the optimisation of a global real estate portfolio and the other is enhancing employee experience by considering global operations as one of the search functions that touch the lives of 200,000+Wiproites daily.
<br><br>
Over the last 100 days post joining Wipro, I’ve witnessed the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct. I think the one word that perfectly describes Wipro and its people is ‘ethical’.</p>

If I wasn’t in my current career, I surely would have been in the IT sector or become a BJJ professor.

Throughout my career, I have got the opportunities to live and work in places like Italy, UK, the USA, and some countries in LATAM.

I’ve always looked up to my mother, who has always inspired me to achieve the best for the moment. In my leisure time, I take my kids, Pedro and Lizi, to the countryside and spend quality time there.</p>

I believe that we can transform Wipro into a dominant technology player, generating value and fueling growth for our customers. Wipro is an organization with a strong technology DNA and takes pride in its craftsmanship. I am looking forward to executing 3 C's to accomplish such a transformation.
<br><br>
The first C is Competency, which we will build through investing in R &amp; D, ecosystem partnerships, and generating brand value earning us the right to play. The second C stands for Capabilities. We will be investing in building platforms and software assets that will help us with faster Time-To-Market, Quality, and Predictability in delivery which will help us serve our customers better. And the third C is Customer-Centricity, focused on leveraging the right technology, assets, and platforms, to solve our customer's pain points. These three C's will lead us to earn the right to win, driving top-line and bottom-line growth.

In regards to my personal life, I live with my family in the Bay area. I have two children; my oldest child is in college and my younger son is a junior in high school.

<br><br>
I joined Wipro in December 2020 as the Senior Vice President and Business Head for Cybersecurity and Risk Services. Previously, I have spent about 17 years at KPMG as a partner of running the US in the global cyber businesses.
<br><br>
As the head of the global Cybersecurity and Risk business, I am really excited to take full advantage of all of the opportunities to become a global leader in a full suite of services in cyber-- advisory services, system integration services, in addition to the ongoing run-and-operate of managed  services. My strategy is to help us move from a leader position in one discipline to all three disciplines, and we will achieve that through senior talent acquisition, by refreshing our service catalogs, methodologies and frameworks, and go-to-market approach.
<br><br>
The one word I would use to describe Wipro and the people of Wipro is “passion”. I've seen it in every individual that I've met and worked with. Their passion for the customers, culture and the communities we serve is unrivaled in the industry today. I'm extremely happy to be here and I look forward to working with each and every one of you. Take care.
<br><br>
Speaking about my family, I live with my wife Nita, daughter Maya, who is 18 and my son Gian, who is 13 in Naperville, Illinois. I’ve been married since 1999 and it's been an unbelievable experience ever since.</p>

<br><br>
Hello, I’m Robert, and I’ve joined Wipro in April’21 as the VP and Global Head of Change and Transformation. Over the last 10 years of my work
experience at Microsoft, I have helped in building the organisational change practice to bring transformation.
<br><br>
On a personal note, I’m a business psychologist living in Switzerland in the countryside with my family. I have three kids, and playing Lego
works like a stress buster to me. Well, I’m a Lego Serious play professional facilitator too. One of my hobbies is wedding planning, and I've
been doing this only for very close friends and family members for the last 20 years. I’m passionate about helping people grow through high
energetic events; it’s that same passion that I’m looking forward to bringing into the business within Wipro.
<br><br>
That being said, Wipro is not just a job for me but my passion to help drive growth and change for people. I think the key focus areas for
bringing change and transformation practice is basically twofold. Here, one is to help leaders and managers to run their change initiatives
for top and bottom-line impact. The other is to create energy and movement to bring people together in workshop settings, community
events to connect the dots and help in providing clarity around the change initiatives.</p>
